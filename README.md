# Description_generator
This repository is an NLP program that takes data as input and transforms it into a coherent paragraph.

This program is adapted to property description using the keytotext repository: https://github.com/gagan3012/keytotext

Keytotext is based on the Amazing T5 Model and is trainable therefore you can adapt it to any use.

The Description_generator.ipynb file is a step by step commented python code on how to generate the description needed.
